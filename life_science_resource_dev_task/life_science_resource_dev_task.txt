LIFE SCIENCE RESOURCE DEVELOPER TASK & PRESENTATION

** CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT PASS TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENCIES **

Please complete the tasks described below and prepare a presentation of your results, including some discussion of methods used and evidence. Your presentation should last 10-15 mins. If possible, please email your presentation in advance of the interview, and bring a copy with you on USB key or CD if you wish. A laptop will be available for the interview. Please let me know if you have any questions.

TASK 1. PROTEIN THESAURUS
-------------------------

You are given the following 16 proteins (using the corresponding Entrez Gene official symbols):

ABCC8
CACNA1A
FRAP1
INS
INSR
IRS1
KCNJ11
KRAS
MAP2K1
PIK3CA
PPARG
PTPN1
RAF1
RPS6KB1
SLC2A2
SOS1

Please divide the proteins into specific families (e.g. kinases, GPCRs and phosphatases) and arrange them in a taxonomy/thesaurus that includes some example synonyms for each of the proteins. Your thesaurus should be in the format described below.

You can use publicly available resources such as Entrez, and any other mechanisms you can think of, to find suitable synonyms. How would you scale this process up if the list had contained 1,000 proteins?

Please also suggest a disease area to which all the 16 proteins might be related and describe a mechanism linking a protein to the disease. 


TASK 2. PROTEIN/GENE INTERACTIONS
---------------------------------

You are given an "ontology" of relationships in ANSI Thesaurus format (Relational Ontology, below), and a list of entities of interest:

c-fos
c-jun
IFN-gamma
IL-2
IL-6
Interferon gamma
kappa B-3
ISG
LTB4
M-CSF
Nef
NF-kappa B
PKC
PMA

You are given 200 scientific abstracts. These are provided as XML wrapped plain text, 200abstracts.xml.

Using the ontology as input, please write a program or script, i.e. in Python, to extract relationships (as specified in the ontology) occurring between the entities of interest in the supplied abstracts.

Your program should take as input the ontology and the document, and should output the relationships in tab-separated format, e.g.

RELN	ENTITY1	ENTITY2	SENTENCE

where RELN is the preferred term for the relationship from the ontology. ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 are the entities found. SENTENCE is the sentence from which the relationship was extracted. 

Please do not take too much time refining your method, but make notes of any enhancements you might have considered with more time.

NOTES
-----

THESAURUS FORMAT

The format to be used is a derivation of the ISO standard "2788/ANSI
Z39.19-1993 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of
Monolingual Thesauri". The syntax is straightforward and allows the
definition of node IDs, preferred terms, synonyms and children, as
follows: 

NodeID1
    PT Preferred Term
    SYN Synonym 1
    SYN Synonym 2
    SYN Synonym N
    NT Child1ID
    NT Child2ID
    NT ChildMID

NodeID2
    PT Preferred Term
    ...

Only the preferred term and node ID are required to define a node; the
NT (narrower term or child) and SYN nodes are optional. The node ID
should be unique.

In the ontology you should assume that the PTs are not treated as synonyms. These supply the standardised name for the relationship to be shown in the output.
